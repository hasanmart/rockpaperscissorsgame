  In this game, you have three options: rock, paper, and scissors. When the game starts, you are greeted with an entry screen that offers some choices: 'Play', 'How to Play', 'Credits', and 'Exit'.
  When you press 'Play', it asks you how many rounds you want to play. First, you select the number of rounds and start playing. When the game ends, it presents you again with the options 'Play' and 'Exit'. If you choose 'Play Again', you have to enter a new round in the game; however, you can exit the terminal by selecting'Exit'.
